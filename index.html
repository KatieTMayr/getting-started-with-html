<h1>Katie Mayr: Stage O Notes</h1>

<b>Web 101</b>

<p> <em>People communicate with browsers that communicate with servers via HTTP requests.</em> 
<br><br>
The above concept was very clearly explained and I loved the little hand drawn diagram! As much as I love the program so far, I have to add that the term "protocol" was not
clearly defined by the Udacity instructor before use but a Google search yielded:
<br><br>
Any Web server machine contains, in addition to the Web page files it can serve, an HTTP daemon, a program that is designed to wait for HTTP requests and handle them when they arrive.
Your Web browser is an HTTP client, sending requests to server machines. When the browser user enters file requests by either "opening" a Web file (typing in a Uniform Resource Locator
or URL) or clicking on a hypertext link, the browser builds an HTTP request and sends it to the Internet Protocol address (IP address) indicated by the URL. The HTTP daemon in the
destination server machine receives the request and sends back the requested file or files associated with the request. (A Web page often consists of more than one file.)"</p>

<b>Tags -->  Elements --> HTML</b>
<p>Web pages, of which there are an estimated 30 billion, are comprised of HTML which stands for Hypertext Markup Language. This languge tells the broswer what content to load into
the bowser window, how to structure it and also how to style it. CSS(cascading style sheet) is a more complex way to command the page display but works with HTML to give a more
enhanced browsing experience. </p>

<p class="tab">HTML elements can be inline or block. Inline elements do not separate text where block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them and push subsequent
text to a new line.</p>
